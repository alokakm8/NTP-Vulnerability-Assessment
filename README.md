# NTP-Vulnerability-Assessment
NTP Vulnerability Assessment and Defense mechanism
Delorean is an NTP server written in python, open source and available from GitHub (contributions are welcomed).
I borrowed a few lines of code from kimifly's ntpserver and, of course, all the credits to him have been included.
